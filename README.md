The Graves Art Sales data is available thanks to the tireless work of [Tracy Berg-Fulton](https://github.com/BergFulton).
We hope to use *Graves* as a source for adding and supplementing the people and tours of Itinera.

Some preliminary visualizations based on this data are available at: http://bit.ly/gravesart
